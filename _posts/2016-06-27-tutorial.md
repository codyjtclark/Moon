# Using SendGrid with BriteVerify
##Creating a new API Key
To use BriteVerify to verify your SendGrid list, you will need to generate an API Key within SendGrid. 

Warning: The Sendgrid-generated key is generated and visible only once, so be sure to copy the API Key somewhere safe for future reference. 
{: .notice}

To get started, open the BriteVerify app and click **Import List** and then click **Sendgrid**. The app triggers the prompt to input the Sendgrid API key. This authentication is required only once to link the two applications.
