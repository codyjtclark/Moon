Happy National Doughnut Day, Honda!

In case you haven't heard, On Friday, June 6th, [Dunkin’ Donuts](http://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/a-sweet-deal-round-the-world-dunkin-donuts-to-offer-free-donuts-for-national-donut-day-on-june-6) is offering a free doughnut with the purchase of any beverage, and if that’s not good enough, [Krispy Kream](http://www.krispykreme.com/NationalDoughnutDay) is also celebrating by offering one free doughnut of any variety—no purchase required!

Free doughnuts are nice, but why do we even celebrate such a silly holiday? 

There's actually some debate to the origins of National Doughnut Day. Some say that Salvation Army started it to help raise money and awareness for its social programs during the Great Depression. Others suggest that it dates all the way back to World War I when Helen Purviance and Margaret Sheldon served homemade doughnuts to American soldiers stationed in France. 

Their operation supposedly started off small—an empty wine bottle as a roller and a fryer capable of frying only 7 doughnuts at a time. But somehow their cause grew and the 150 doughnuts they made could make daily grew to over 9,000!

In any event, remember to grab your free doughnut this Friday, and don't forget to say thanks!
