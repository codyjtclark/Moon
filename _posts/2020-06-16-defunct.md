From school assignments to intern projects, this Jekyll site has served me well. However, I've accepted a job offer
and can finally take back my writing. Maybe I'll turn this site into a blog or portfolio again, but for now, I think
I'll let it memorialize 

- learning about Jekyll and static site generators at SendGrid 
- finishing my BA in Professional Writing and Information Design
- landing an internship with Google
- my graduate coursework in tech com

Thank you, professors, hosts and mentors! And with this commit, this site is officially defunct.

Best,
Cody
