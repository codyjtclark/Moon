# Foreword

I would like to thank the departments of Cedarville University for contributing data that will allow you, the
reader, to get an overall picture of Cedarville University. Also, I would specifically like to thank Cody Clark, who
created the factbook skillfully using Adobe InDesign. Thanks also to Fran Campbell, our University Registrar,
and Marketing.

Please contact me as you use this volume and see the need for a new way of presenting the information or
identify a new area we can cover.

Lindsey McCarty
Director of Institutional Research
