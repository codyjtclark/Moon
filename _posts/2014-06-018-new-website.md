**HRA launches redesigned external website today**

In 1999 and 2000 associates from HR, ISD, NC, DB2, and MR1 served on the NH Circles which established hondaresearch.com. For 14 years this site served as the primary resource to recruit and give potential employees an opportunity to learn about HRA.

However, a situation analysis performed in 2013 showed this previous platform had one critical shortcoming: HRA could not update content at will. Even basic changes had to pass through an outside vendor, a costly and time-consuming process.

Today, HRA has launched a revamped external website featuring a content management system that will allow CTC to make changes directly. This streamlined process not only saves time and money but also gives us the ability to automatically update content so it's never out of date!

“When we were conducting our situation analysis, we discovered HAM was redesigning their website through o2ideas, a creative agency based in Birmingham, Alabama,” says Jennifer Dahlgren (CTC). “We were able to save valuable time and resources by using the existing structure and basic programming while developing unique content and a different look and feel for the site.”

The new site features more than a content management system and new design. 

“Starting with the previous site as the foundation, we analyzed additional content opportunities and expanded the site to include our history, background and current capabilities,” says Dahlgren. “We also included social media and news links to give visitors a complete picture of what we’re all about as an organization.”

Through collaboration and attention to detail, this redesigning process has gone very smoothly.

“A good foundation was already laid when I was assigned this project,” said Cody Bradford, CTC student associate and redesign PIC. “Cody Clark revised the content to be clear and concise, and I coordinated with o2ideas to implement the final edits and layout updates. My goal was to create a dynamic and informative product that best reflects HRA, and I think this new website does that.”

The new website contains pages that feature HRA news, values, and community. The website also has a new, engaging job opportunities page for potential associates to learn more about the different careers available at HRA.
