This project was an exercise in using visual elements including arrangement and typographical principles to attempt to emphasize different levels of text.

## **Composition 1 - Alphabetic Character** 

### **Overview** 
Knowing that the typical Western reader views documents in an F-shaped pattern, I decided to place the alphabetic character at the top left. To add visual balance to the document I then added the body copy to the bottom right, but the weight still seemed off so I decided to enclose the alphabetic in a colored circle. Even though the text is takes up more visual space, the filled circle feels more dense. The elements’ proximity also helps to lead the eye from the alphabetic character to the body text. 
I actually toned down the contrast by adding an orange tint to an otherwise white background, but the lessened contrast made for a more cohesive document by providing a consistent color palette. I tried to get both paragraphs to be the same size to give a sense of repetition, but that would have required extensive rewriting so I opted for close enough. 

### **Typeface** 

I’m a huge fan skeuomorphisms, so I used Courier to emulate a typewriter. I figured that this would fit in on the About page for a portfolio and with the white space and minimalistic color choices, I figured that this would fit on a designer’s portfolio. In the same realm, I decided to justify the text to give it a newspaper feel. It’s too hipster and ironic for me to actually use, but I think everything works together. 

### **Reflection**

 I’m honestly not too sure what the character is, but I liked that I appears to be a mirrored K which relates back to the phonetic sounds of my initials. I’m pleased with how most of this composition turned out, but given more flexible options in text, I would like to fix how the text was justified to help create more balanced and logical lines and line breaks. I hate how both paragraphs end with orphaned words, but it was either orphans or breaking up words, so I chose the former.

## **Composition 2 - Title** 

### **Overview** 

My second composition still uses white space but focuses more on an angular, almost geometric design. I use the leading lines of the shapes to point to the title. I also attempt to emphasize the title by coloring it the same color as the background which provides a stark contrast to the other blues. Playing with the opacity allowed me to create more triangles from overlapping shapes. 
I reduced the alphabetic symbol to wrap around the body text. There’s a strong contrast between the white background and the dark blue text, and I tried to make the white space around the margins as even as possible.

### **Reflection**

There’s a certain uneasy feel as none of the lines are perfectly parallel, but at the same time that uneasiness also provides a sense of interest. I don’t think I built up enough contrast between the figure and the ground, but I’m happy with the spacing proximity.
Given more time I would have been more precise with the color palette. Similarly, I think that the visual weight might be too unbalanced. I would also love to add [this font]( https://www.behance.net/gallery/5471329/Angular-Font) to the title, but I wasn’t able to find it download.

## **Composition 3 - Body** 

### **Reflection**
This composition is definitely my weakest. It looks like a high school’s morning announcement slide, but I didn’t know what else to do. Emphasizing the text over a title figuratively blew my mind as emphasizing the text over the title is a huge paradigm shift from the hierarchical arrangement that’s been ingrained in me
I played with dropping the opacity of the title and placing the body text in front of it, but that looked even worse than the finished product. The colors are complimentary, or at least Adobe color picker says so, but I could definitely tweak that more to help create a better contrast. Similarly, I should probably make the padding from all side of the square be the same size instead of grouping the top and bottom and the left and right sides to create a more consistent proximity.
