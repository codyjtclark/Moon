Hi, my name is Cody Clark, and I'm a recovering prescriptivist currently admitted at Cedarville University. But old habits die hardâ€”my bookcase is still littered with guides like *Garner's Modern English Usage* and the *Chicago Manual of Style*. 

I "technically" write stuff and have written for [SendGrid](https:sendgrid.com), [Informatica](https:informatica.com), and [Honda R&D](www.hondaresearch.com). When I'm not writing, I enjoy playing in pit orchestras, visiting used book shops and arbitrarily omitting Oxford commas.
